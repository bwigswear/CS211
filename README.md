CS 211: Computer Architecture

PA 1 : Several smaller C programs that exhibit basic I/O behavior

PA 2 : A simple machine-learning algorithm that estimates home prices, based on a list of parameters.
       The program is given a file containg a list of existing housing prices and parameters and interprets a correlation
       by implementing the formula for a matrix pseudo-inverse. The resulting correlation matrix can be used
       to calculate unknown house prices given a list of parameters.

PA 4 : Reads in a file containing the description of a circuit, including I/O variables and a list of gates in sequential
       order. Produces a truth table containing a list of output values and all possible input value combinations.
